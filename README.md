# To-do list Web App

This is a simple, interactive To-do List app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides users with an easy way to manage tasks by adding, checking off, and deleting items. It includes a night mode toggle for a better user experience in low light conditions, and it saves data using local storage, so tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add and Delete Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to the list or remove completed tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Click on any task to mark it as completed.
- **Night Mode**: Switch between light and dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience.
- **Task Counter**: Displays the total count of current tasks.
- **Persistent Data**: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so you won't lose your list when you close or refresh the page.
